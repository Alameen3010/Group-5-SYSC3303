SYSC 3303 - Project Group 5 - Iteration 2

Group members and tasks:

Alameen Alliu (101159780): Elevator Subsystem

Taran Basati (101161332): JUnit Testing

Rozba Hakam (101190098): State Diagram, ReadMe

Iteration Description:
This iteration focuses on adding state machines for the scheduler and elevator subsystems, assuming a single elevator setup, with plans to optimize passenger throughput through multi-elevator coordination in future iterations.

Files Description:
Scheduler.java: Manages and schedules requests from the floor subsystem to the elevator subsystem using a state machine.

Elevator.java: Represents an elevator subsystem with functionalities for handling elevator operations and door states through a state machine.
